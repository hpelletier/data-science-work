*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

```

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

**Observations**:

- Generally, the higher the carat, the higher the price of the diamond. 
- There are some outliers in the top-right that have a lower-than-expected price for their carat value given the trend. Perhaps another characteristic brings down the price of these diamonds.

__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut))
```

**Observations**:

- Generally, the better the cut of the diamond, the higher the price.
- This graph gives us more insight into the outliers in the top-right. The three highest-carat diamonds have "Fair" cuts. This could explain why their price is similar to that of diamonds with lower carat values but better cuts. 

__Bonus__:

```{r bonus}
diamonds_f <- diamonds %>%
  filter(
    carat %in% c(1.00, 1.50, 2.00)
  )

ggplot() +
  geom_point(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(diamonds_f, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price), color = "red")
```
**Observations**:

- Diamonds tend to have "round" carat values (e.g. 1, 1.5, and 2 carats). 
- This is especially apparent around the 2-carat line. There are almost no diamonds that are slightly less than 2 carats, but many that are exactly 2 carats.


# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
